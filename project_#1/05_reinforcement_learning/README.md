## Definitions

### Agent

### Environment
The world though which the agent moves

### Action (A)
All the possible steps that the agent cat take

### State (S)
Current condition returned by the environment

### Reward (R)
An instant return from the environment to appraise the last action

### Policy (Ï€)
The approach that the agent uses to determine the next action based on the current state

### Value (V)
The expected long-term return with discount, as opposed to the short-term reward R

### Action-value (Q)
This similar to Value, except, it takes as extra parameter, the current action (A)


## Exploration and Exploitation

_Exploitation_ is about using the already exploited information to heighten the reward.

_Exploration_ is about exploring and capturing more information about an environment.
